# NLTK_Toy
Python code for learning NLTK
I'm trying to use ngrams to identify multi-word searches in a text document like "Hidden Cobra". I've got RegEx working but
wanted to compare to bigrams/ngrams from NLTK for both accuracy and speed. Eventually I'll need to search for up to
2000 search terms.
